StackBuilder
============

StackBuilder is a simple palettization software (homogeneous case stacking).

It helps you solve 3 problems:
* palettization : given a case and a pallet, find the best layout to stack the case,
* case filling : given a set of cases, find the best case and the best way to fill it,
* optimal case search : given a box, a number of box per case and a pallet type, find the optimal case layout and dimensions.

StackBuilder can not handle heterogeneous problems such as:
* palletizing with several case types,
* producing solutions that do not rely on layers
